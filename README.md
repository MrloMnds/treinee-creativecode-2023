Basic CRUD with Express and MySQL (Relation 1:N)

Hi!

- Inside controllers folder you'll find the contacts controller class and the phoneNumbers controller class.
  Each one for its own basic CRUD.
  
- In database folder we have the connection.example.js file, which is only an example of how you should connect
  with the database of your choice. You will have to manually create the selected database using SQL commands.
  Change the name of "connection.example.js" to "connection.js" once you have edited it.

- The routes folder is self explanatory, it contains the routes files with the HTTP requests.

- The createTables.sql file is the one you can use to create contacts and phonenumbers tables in your database.
  I recommend using it for avoiding errors in the testing process.
